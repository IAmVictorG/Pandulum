# Pendulum Simulation

This project simulates the motion of a pendulum using physics principles. The simulation is built using SFML and GLM, focusing on accurate representations of the pendulum's movement over time.

# Features

  Accurate simulation of pendulum motion.
  
  Real-time adjustments based on changing frame rates.
  
  Physics-based interactions including gravity, angular velocity.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

  SFML installed.
  GLM library available.
  C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
  Building the Project
